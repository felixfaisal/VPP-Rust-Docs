# VPP Binary API Union 

## What is VPP? 
The VPP platform is an extensible framework that provides out-of-the-box production quality switch/router functionality. It is the `open source version of Cisco's Vector Packet Processing (VPP) technology`: a high performance, packet-processing stack that can run on commodity CPUs.

To understand the project better I went through youtube videos of VPP which are <br>

## What is Binary API 
VPP provides a binary API scheme to allow a wide variety of client codes to program data-plane tables. As of this writing, there are hundreds of binary APIs.
You can also consider them to be some sort of **psuedocode** which is ingested to produce api bindings for a specific client. Currently there are api bindings for Go, Python, C, C++
